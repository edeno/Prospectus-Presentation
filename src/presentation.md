> "Each of the objects and events we encounter in the environment affords a range of possible actions in response to it. The **appropriate response** varies as a function of the **task**"
--- Rogers & Monsell (1995)

# Rule / Task Set

What determines appropriate response?

. . .

Explicit Goals or Intention

OR

Context and Learned Rules (Internal states)

. . .

\+

. . .

Environmental stimuli

. . .

=

Appropriate Response

<aside class="notes">
+  conceptual boundary for what constitutes distinct tasks fuzzy
+  Can adopt rules / task sets before knowing what environmental stimuli there are
+  An environmental stimuli might have a strong response associated with it, but we can pick a weaker, more appropriate response
</aside>

# Cognitive Demand: The monitoring and allocation of control

<aside class="notes">
+  need to configure appropriate set of processes linking sensory to motor (categorization, mapping, response)
+  Don't always need to control

# Prefrontal Cortex is important for monitoring and allocation of control

# Dynamics

# Functional Organization of the Prefrontal Cortex

# The problem of the ACC

# Mixed selectivity

# Outline
- Task Switching Paradigm
- Aim \#1: LFP Analysis
- Aim \#2  Single Neuron and Population Analysis
- NEW Aim \#3: Tools for multi-dimensional investigation of electrophyisological datasets
- Status of the Project

# Task Switching Paradigm

# Factors that Aï¬€ect the Amount of Attention Needed

# Aim \#1

# Rule-dependent networks in dlPFC

# Analysis of ACC and dlPFC-ACC Synchrony

# Aim \#2

# Motivation for Aim \#2 and Aim \#3

# Tools for Investigating Multi-dimensional Models

# SFN Poster 1 and 2 Problems

# Proposed Corrections at Qualifying Exam

# Current State: Proposed models

# Aim \#3

# The purpose of visualization in science

# Static visualizations are limited in multi-dimensional investigations

# Interactive visualizations can help us quickly make comparisons and deal with complexity

# Dynamic visualizations, when combined with interactivity, can help us understand complex data by preserving relationships between data

# Web-enabled visualizations are familiar, easily shareable, and enable analysis transparency
