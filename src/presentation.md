--- Rogers & Monsell (1995)

# Rule / Task Set / Context

-  
# Cognitive Demand: The monitoring and allocation of control

# Functional Organization of the Prefrontal Cortex

# The problem of the ACC

# Worrying about mixed selectivity

# Task Switching Paradigm

# Factors that Aï¬€ect the Amount of Attention Needed

# Outline

- Aim \#1: LFP Analysis
- Aim \#2  Single Neuron and Population Analysis
- NEW Aim \#3: Tools for multi-dimensional investigation of electrophyisological datasets
- Status of the Project

# Aim \#1

# Rule-dependent networks in dlPFC

# Analysis of ACC and dlPFC-ACC Synchrony

# Aim \#2

# Motivation for Aim \#2 and Aim \#3

# Tools for Investigating Multi-dimensional Models

# SFN Poster 1 and 2 Problems

# Proposed Corrections at Qualifying Exam

# Current State: Proposed models

# Aim \#3

# The purpose of visualization in science

# Static visualizations are limited in multi-dimensional investigations

# Interactive visualizations can help us quickly make comparisons and deal with complexity

# Dynamic visualizations, when combined with interactivity, can help us understand complex data by preserving relationships between data

# Web-enabled visualizations are familiar, easily shareable, and enable analysis transparency
