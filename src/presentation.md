# Background: The Role of ACC and dlPFC in Supporting Flexible Behavior

# The Dataset

# Task Factors that Aï¬€ect the Amount of Attention Needed

# Aim \#1

# Rule-dependent networks in dlPFC

# Analysis of ACC and dlPFC-ACC Synchrony

# Current State: Proposed models

# Aim \#3

# The purpose of visualization in science

# Static visualizations are limited in multi-dimensional investigations

# Interactive visualizations can help us quickly make comparisons and deal with complexity

# Dynamic visualizations, when combined with interactivity, can help us understand complex data by preserving relationships between data

# Web-enabled visualizations are familiar, easily shareable, and enable analysis transparency
