# Cognitive Demand: The monitoring and allocation of control

Adjustments in control can occur rapidly. Reaction time and accuracy tend to change:

+  After errors

+  Repeating the same task

+  When switching between tasks

+  When responding to stimuli with more than response associated with them

+  Fluctuations in control

+  limited capacity for control

# Prefrontal Cortex is important for monitoring and allocation of control

+  Perseverative behavior after injury

+  Neurons that respond selectivity to one rule

# Dynamics: How is activity on network level in PFC coordinated so that the appropriate response is selected?

+  PFC neurons need to be able flexibly represent and switch between rules to bias other areas toward the appropriate sensory-motor representations.

+  They need to suppress inappropriate sensory-motor representations.

<aside class="notes">
Theory #1: Selection-For-Action â€“ The ACC is responsible for selecting the relevant sensory information to make an action. It prevents competition between possible responses. Factors predicted: Rule, Test Stimulus, Response Direction.

Theory #2: Error Detection â€“ The ACC makes a comparison between the response in progress and the intended response (the correct response) or between the received reward and expected reward. Can also use that comparison to adjust or correct responses even as the response is ongoing. Factors predicted: Previous Error, Response Direction.

Theory #3: Conflict Monitoring â€“ The ACC detects incompatible representations (responses, stimuli, contexts, etc.) and signals lateral prefrontal areas to make attentional adjustments. Factors predicted: Switch, Previous Error, Congruency.

Theory #4: Response-Outcome Associations/Reinforcement Learning â€“ The ACC learns to associate responses with an expected outcome (positive or negative) and the amount of effort required to achieve that outcome (cost and frequency of response, action-reward ratios) â€“ Pr(Outcome | Response). In the context of cued task switching, the ACCâ€™s role should be less central, since response and reward combinations are not particularly informative. Factors predicted: Previous Error, Response Direction.

Theory #5: Error Likelihood â€“ ACC learns to associate error with the active stimulus-response representation that caused the error (through a self-organizing map trained by a dopamine teaching signal), meaning ACC detects the situations in which an error is more likely. Factors predicted: Rule, Switch, Previous Error, Test Stimulus, Response Direction.

Theory #6: Predicted Response-Outcome: The ACC learns to associate predictions of responses and their outcomes given a stimulus context â€“Pr(Response, Outcome | Context). ACC signals when an unexpected non-occurrence of a predicted outcome occurs (negative surprise). Factors predicted: Rule, Previous Error, Response Direction, and possibly Switch, Congruency

Theory #7: Multidimensional error signals generated by ACC are used to train error prediction representations in dlPFC, and, once trained, error  representations maintained by dlPFC are a basis of working memory signals  that suffice to guide task performance. Specifically, the dlPFC learns to maintain representations of stimuli that reliably co-occur with prediction errors (Friston, 2010). In turn, the dlPFC error prediction representations are deployed by ACC to refine predictions about the likely outcomes of actions

# Aim \#2

<aside class="notes">
Motivation for Aim \#2 and Aim \#3

Our goal is to characterize the cellular-level contributions of ACC and dlPFC neurons and their relationship to the circuit-level activity. See if they can tell us something different from the LFP analysis.

Also use multi-dimensional generalized linear regression models to account for mixed selectivity.

# SFN Poster Problems

+  Many low firing rate neurons (75% of neurons < 10 Hz)

+  Approach too data-mining centric

+  Not enough analysis of effect size

+  Smoothing over time with splines inconsistent

# Proposed Corrections at Qualifying Exam

+ Fit one big model and examine effects

+ Use regularization as a soft-threshold to constrain the fitting space
