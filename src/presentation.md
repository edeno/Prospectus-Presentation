## Background: The Role of ACC and dlPFC in Supporting Flexible Behavior

### The Dataset

### Task Factors that Aï¬€ect the Amount of Attention Needed

## Aim \#1: Synchronous Oscillatory Neural Ensembles for Rules in the Prefrontal Cortex

### Rule-dependent networks in dlPFC

### Analysis of ACC and dlPFC-ACC Synchrony

## Aim \#2: The Functional Contribution of ACC and dlPFC Neurons to Circuit-level Dynamics and Behavior during Task Switching

## Motivation for Aim \#2 and Aim \#3

### Tools for Investigating Multi-dimensional Models

### SFN Poster 1 and 2 Problems

### Proposed Corrections at Qualifying Exam

### Current State: Proposed models

## Aim \#3: Visualizations

### The purpose of visualization in science

### Static visualizations are limited in multi-dimensional investigations

### Interactive visualizations can help us quickly make comparisons and deal with complexitys

### Dynamic visualizations, when combined with interactivity, can help us understand complex data by preserving relationships between data

### Web-enabled visualizations are familiar, easily shareable, and enable analysis transparency
