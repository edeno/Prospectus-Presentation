+  conceptual boundary for what constitutes distinct tasks fuzzy
+  Can adopt rules / task sets before knowing what environmental stimuli there are
+  An environmental stimuli might have a strong response associated with it, but we can pick a weaker, more appropriate response
</aside>

# Cognitive Demand: The monitoring and allocation of control

Adjustments in control can occur rapidly. Reaction time and accuracy tend to change:

+  After errors
+  Repeating the same task
+  When switching between tasks
+  When responding to stimuli with more than response associated with them

+  Don't always need to control
+  Fluctuations in control
+ Stroop task: When responding to stimuli with more than response associated with them (congruency)
  + Interestingly, effect isn't as strong when there are more incongruent trials relative to congruent trials

# Prefrontal Cortex is important for monitoring and allocation of control

+  Perseverative behavior after injury
+  Task responsive neurons

# Dynamics: How is activity on network level in PFC coordinated so that the appropriate response is selected?

+  PFC neurons need to be able flexibly represent and switch between rules to bias other areas toward the appropriate sensory-motor representations.

+  They need to suppress inappropriate sensory-motor representations.

# Aim \#2

# Motivation for Aim \#2 and Aim \#3

# SFN Poster Analysis and Problems

+  Many low firing rate neurons (histogram here)
+  Approach too data-mining centric (need to focus hypothesis)
+  Solution: **Regularization**

# Proposed Corrections at Qualifying Exam

+ Fit one big model and examine effects
+ Problem: Interpretability

# Current Status: Constrained set of models

# Demonstration that models work

# Current Problem

# Dynamic visualizations, when combined with interactivity, can help us understand complex data by preserving relationships between data

# Web-enabled visualizations are familiar, easily shareable, and enable analysis transparency
