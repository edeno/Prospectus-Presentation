+  Can adopt rules / task sets before knowing what environmental stimuli there are
+  An environmental stimuli might have a strong response associated with it, but we can pick a weaker, more appropriate response

# Cognitive Demand: The monitoring and allocation of control

Adjustments in control can occur rapidly. Reaction time and accuracy tend to change:

+  After errors
+  Repeating the same task
+  When switching between tasks
+  When responding to stimuli with more than response associated with them

+ Stroop task: When responding to stimuli with more than response associated with them (congruency)
  + Interestingly, effect isn't as strong when there are more incongruent trials relative to congruent trials

Interactive Visualizations

# WHY: Statistical summaries can be misleading

<span class="parenthetical">(Visualizations help us check our assumptions)</span>

# WHY: We are collecting more data

+  More data → more complex theories → more comparisons

. . .

+  Multidimensional data requires multiple views and summaries to fully understand

. . .

+  Harder to display all the data on a single static figure

. . .

+  Examining raw data becomes more difficult

# Interactive visualizations can help us quickly make comparisons and deal with complexity

![Heer & Shneiderman (2012)](img/heer-table.svg)

# Dynamic visualizations, when combined with interactivity, can help us understand complex data by preserving relationships between data

# Web-enabled visualizations are familiar, easily shareable, and enable analysis transparency
